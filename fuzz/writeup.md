For part 3, I was not able to run lcov command in my Visual Studio Code. Whenever I run lcov command I get an error saying: "lcov : The term 'lcov' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again."
